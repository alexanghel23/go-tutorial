package main

/*
Polymorphism
- ability for an object to have different form depending on the context
- identical at high level of abstraction
- different at low level of abstraction

Example: Area() function
- Rectangle, area = base * height
- Triangle, area = 0*5 * base * height

Inheritance
- usually used in oop languages to support polymorphism is inheritance
- golang doesn't support inheritance
Example: Speaker superclass, subclasses Cat and Dog

Overriding
- subclass redefines a method inherited from the superclass
