package main

/*

Functions as return values
- functions can return functions
- might create a function with controllable parameters
- not so common to use

Environment of a Function
- set of all names that are valid inside a function
- Go is lexically scoped

Closure
- function + its environment
- when functions are passed/returned, their environment comes with them
